# US-Flight-Pattern-Analysis
This project analyzes a large dataset of US commercial flights from 1999 to 2008 . Dataset found: https://dataverse.harvard.edu/citation?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/HG7NV7

The main goals were to:
- Identify the best times and days of the week to minimise flight delays each year.
- Assess whether older planes experience more delays on a year-to-year basis.
- Build logistic regression models predicting the probability of flight diversions using flight attributes such as departure times, airport coordinates, distances, and carriers, and visualize coefficient changes across years.

The project involves extensive data wrangling, cleaning, and statistical modeling using both Python and R. The analysis includes reproducible codes and clear visualizations supporting the findings.
